## Dataset Overview

Describing your dataset and what data it contains:
This dataset, titled "Electric Vehicle Population Data," was obtained from data.gov, a U.S.
government website that provides public access to government datasets. It contains information
about electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in the United States. The dataset has 25
rows (each representing a unique vehicle registration) and 18 columns (each representing a
specific attribute of the vehicle or its registration).
Columns/Data Types
- VIN (1-10): (Text) The first ten characters of the Vehicle Identification Number. This
serves as a partial unique identifier for each vehicle.
- County: (Text) The name of the county where the vehicle is registered.
- City: (Text) The name of the city where the vehicle is registered.
- State: (Text) The US state where the vehicle is registered.
- Postal Code: (Numeric/Text) The zip code of the vehicle's registered address.
- Model Year: (Numeric) The year the vehicle was manufactured.
- Make: (Text) The manufacturer of the vehicle.
- Model: (Text) The specific model of the vehicle.
- Electric Vehicle Type: (Text) Categorizes the vehicle as either "Battery Electric Vehicle
(BEV)" or "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)".
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility: (Text) Indicates whether the vehicle
meets the criteria to be classified as a Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle. The specific
eligibility criteria can vary by state and may consider factors like electric range. Values
might include "Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligible," "Not eligible due to low battery
range," or similar classifications.
- Electric Range: (Numeric) The estimated range the vehicle can travel on a single
electric charge, measured in miles. For PHEVs, this refers to the electric-only range.
- Base MSRP: (Numeric) The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of the vehicle at the
time of its release, in US dollars.
- Legislative District: (Numeric) The legislative district where the vehicle is registered.
The level and numbering of these districts will vary by state.
- VIN Vehicle ID: (Numeric) A unique identification number assigned to the vehicle by the
Department of Licensing (or equivalent agency) in the respective state.
- Vehicle Location: (Text) A textual representation of the vehicle's approximate location,
often provided as a geographic coordinate (latitude and longitude) in a point format,
sometimes accompanied by a nearby landmark or city name.
- Electric Utility: (Text) The name of the electric utility provider that serves the registered
address of the vehicle owner. This will vary significantly by location.
- 2020 Census Tract: (Numeric) The census tract, based on the 2020 US Census, where
the vehicle is registered. This provides a more granular geographic identifier.

## Question 1
What are the top 5 electric car manufactures in the USA?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62e2e37f-367d-41a1-ba5c-ba4178ba7abb)

We chose to represent this question in a bar graph format. Each bar graph includes the different types of models a manufacturer has and all the years a car was produced by a manufacturer.

This is an important question as it highlights the best manufacturer in the electric car industry. The main reason different auto manufacturers would want to see who the best in the electric car industry is to get advice on how to build better electric cars to compete in the market. For example, in our data set, Tesla was the best manufacturer. However, let's say Kia and Ford wanted to improve their car, they can see based on our bar graph that Tesla is the best and ask for advice on how to improve their cars, whether itâ€™s through battery technology, providing a larger charging network, they can collaborate and provide parts to one another, etc. 


## Question 2
Which county has the most electric cars in Califronia?
